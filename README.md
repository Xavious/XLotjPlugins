# XLotjPlugins

This is my personal repository of Lotj related plugins for MUSHclient.

## Installation
To download a plugin from GitHub, without their markup on it, you need to click the individual plugin you want, click the "raw" button, and download it that way. Here's a quick and simple demonstration of how to download and install a plugin in MUSHclient:

## Lotj\_Mapper

The mapper that most are probably familiar with if you've downloaded "LotjClient", the preconfigured version of MUSHclient with an assortment of community made plugins already installed.

## Lotj\_Voter

This is the auto voter I wrote with Lua sockets to handle the monotonous task of logging into Mudconnector and voting for Lotj on a daily schedule.

## Lotj\_SpaceHud

My latest and greatest creation based on the premise of asking myself, "How cool would it be to have an Eve Online like space overview for Lotj?"

It's mostly a finished product, but my interest in unraveling the intricacies of scroll bars, and their operation inside of a MUSHclient mini window, has waned. Therefore, the current scroll bars only support single click functionality for moving up and down while the scrollbar itself doesn't work in any capacity, and holding down the arrows to scroll doesn't work either. Motivating myself to even complete that much was a chore, as I've personally rarely used scroll arrows since the advent of the mouse wheel. However, I do feel like a draggable scroll bar would be a boon, but alas, a project for another day perhaps. 

Feel free to send me bug reports or pull requests. This is one of my most organized and well structured MUSHclient plugin projects, so in my eyes it's probably easier to modify than my previous work.
