# XLotjPlugins

This is my personal repository of Lotj related plugins for MUSHclient.

## Lotj\_Mapper

The mapper that most are probably familiar with if you've downloaded "LotjClient", the preconfigured version of MUSHclient with an assortment of community made plugins already installed.

## Lotj\_Voter

This is the auto voter I wrote with Lua sockets to handle the monotonous task of logging into Mudconnector and voting for Lotj on a daily schedule.

## Lotj\_SpaceHud

My lateast and greatest creation made with the premise of asking myself, "How cool would it be to have an Eve Online like space overview for Lotj?"

It's mostly a finished product, but my interest in unraveling the intracacies of scroll bars and their operation inside of a mini window has waned. Therefore, the current scrollbars support single click functionality for moving upa nd down, but the scrollbar itself doesn't work in any capacity and holding down the arrows to scroll doesn't work either.

Feel free to send me bug reports or pull requests. This is one of my most organized and well structured MUSHclient plugin projects, so in my eyes it's probably easier to modify than my previous work.
